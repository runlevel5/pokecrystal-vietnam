### Rationale

1. **Community Consistency**: Vietnamese Pokemon players are familiar with English move/item names from online resources, competitive play, and the international community.

2. **Technical Constraints**: The 18-character line limit makes it difficult to translate long move/item names while keeping them readable.

3. **Disambiguation**: English names avoid potential confusion with Vietnamese words that might have different meanings.

4. **Future Compatibility**: Keeping standardized names helps players communicate across language barriers.

|---------|------------|---------|
| PROF. ELM | GS ELM | Giáo Sư (Professor) |
| POKEMON CENTER | TT POKEMON | Trung Tâm (Center) |

| ROUTE | ĐƯỜNG | Road/Route |
| CITY | TP | Thành Phố |
| ELDER | TRƯỞNG LÃO | Elder/Senior |

## Pronoun Guidelines

Vietnamese pronouns are chosen based on relationship and context:

| Relationship | Speaker → Listener |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Rival (rude) | tao → mày |
| Mom → Child | mẹ → con |
| Elder → Youth | ta → con |
| Peer (polite) | tôi → bạn |
| NPC (respectful) | Based on age/status |

## Technical Constraints

- **Max 18 characters per line** (Game Boy screen width)
- Special macros expand: `#` = POKé (4), `#MON` = POKéMON (7), `#DEX` = POKéDEX (7), `#GEAR` = POKéGEAR (8)
- Player/rival names count as 8 characters max
- Pokemon names count as 10 characters max

## Translation Conventions

1. **UPPERCASE keywords stay in English**: If a keyword or term is written in ALL CAPS (e.g., POTION, ATTACK, PIKACHU), leave it in English. These are game-specific identifiers.

2. **Run linter after translation**: Always run the linter to ensure translated lines do not exceed the character limit. Use:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate && python tools/check_text_length.py <file.asm>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   python tools/check_text_length.py data/text/common_1.asm
   ```
