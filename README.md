# Pokémon Crystal Vietnamese translation project

I based my work of the [commit 2ad9616586212e2a9ed3be812776d133dc47bb8a](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/commit/2ad9616586212e2a9ed3be812776d133dc47bb8a)
of the pokecrystal disassembly project and added Vietnamese translation.

As of Feb 3rd 2026, the project is considered complete. Please file bug report if you happen to find any issue.

To aid with your gameplay, please look up the [GLOSSARY](./GLOSSARY.md) for English-Vietnamese translation.

If you are interested in technical decision made for the project, please look up the [DOC](./AGENTS.md)

## TODO

* Add a backward compatability layer to translate between English and Vietnamese for PLAYER_NAME when in battle or trading mode
